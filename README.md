# QuantumGates

**QuantumGates** is a simple and educational repository that demonstrates fundamental quantum computing concepts using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/). This project focuses on simulating the behavior of basic quantum gates and the creation of a Bell state using Jupyter Notebooks.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Pauli-X Gate (NOT Gate)**
- ✅ **Hadamard Gate**
- ✅ **Bell State Generation**

Each concept is implemented with clear code and visualizations to help you understand how quantum gates manipulate qubits.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How the **Pauli-X** gate flips a qubit state
- How the **Hadamard** gate creates superposition
- How to create an **entangled Bell state** using Hadamard and CNOT gates

## 🔧 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eranjanaWR/QuantumGates.git
cd QuantumGates/code
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install qiskit notebook
```
